* Interactions Complicate Debugging (交互使得更难debug)

	+ Is any program truly independent ?	
		- No!

	+ You probably don't realize how much you depend on reproducibility

	+ Non-deterministic errors are really difficult to find!

----------------

* Why allow cooperating threads?

	+ People cooperate; computers help/enhance people's lices, so computers must cooperate
		- By analogy, the non-reproducibility/non-determinism of people is a notable problem for "carefully laid plans"

	+ Advantage 1: Share resources
